<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project


User Story:

- AS A traveler
- I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
- SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

Project Summary:

Keep your finger on the pulse of the weather with this dynamic and user-friendly weather dashboard! Using the trusted OpenWeatherMap API, you can easily search for and view detailed weather data for your favorite cities, including the city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. With a 5-day forecast also at your fingertips, you'll have all the information you need to plan your days with confidence.

This dashboard is designed for convenience, with a search history feature that saves your past searches for easy access, and an automatic theme adjuster that changes the look of the page based on whether it's currently day or night in the searched location. Plus, when the page loads, the geolocation API will automatically determine your current location and display the weather for your area.

In addition to providing an enjoyable user experience, working on this project allowed me to gain valuable experience in accessing and retrieving data from RESTful web APIs using AJAX calls, as well as processing returned data and using it with JavaScript logic to generate dynamic page elements. This enables the application to display customized content based on the responses from the API, making it a versatile and effective tool.
